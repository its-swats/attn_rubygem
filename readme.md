# attn - a gem to catch the eye
attn is a simple Ruby Gem designed to make locating specific lines of output in the terminal easier. This is achieved through creating colored output before and after the lines of code you want to locate or by displaying a line of emojis to act as a standalone line break.

## Installation
```
dev :> gem install attn
```

## Usage
It's as simple as requiring the gem in your project. Once required, attn has 2 modes, and a handful of colorization options.

Require the gem in your file
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> require 'attn'
```

### Line Break

Call the method to insert a line of random emojis
```ruby
irb(main):002:0> attn
ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ  ðŸŒŸ
```

### Variable Display

Call the method with a variable to see it displayed like this
```ruby
irb(main):008:0> attn("Variable_to_highlight")
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†  FINISH â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```

### Variable Display with message

You can also specify a message as a second argument (string) to be displayed in the footer. Easily identifying multiple attn calls.

```ruby

irb(main):010:0> attn("Variable_to_highlight", "thing from that place")
â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡  CLASS: Array LENGTH: 3 CALLER: sandbox.rb:26:in `<main>' â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡ â¬‡

"Variable_to_highlight"

â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† thing from that place â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬† â¬†
```
